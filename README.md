# r2pq-bench

R2PQ Bench is the benchmarking and performance analysis suite for the R2PQ ecosystem.  
Its purpose is to stress-test post-quantum primitives, measure throughput across multiple configurations, and validate stability under load.

## Purpose
- Benchmark R2PQ verification and signing operations  
- Measure end-to-end latency of PQ transactions  
- Analyze performance of R2PQ-SDK and R2PQ-CLI calls  
- Provide reproducible test scripts and outputs  
- Support CI-based benchmarking for performance regression detection  

## Structure

/benchmarks       # Benchmark scripts /results          # Generated reports and logs /config           # Test profiles (CPU, GPU, hybrid)

## Getting Started
Setup instructions will be added after the first implementation pass.

## Status
✅ Initialized  
🚧 Awaiting first code push
